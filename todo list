Autoflight:
  Flyclear to clear all autoflight variables to help with debugging as well as people getting stuck
  Change 'calc' alias to 'autocalc' alias, so it isn't triggered when people are trying to calc somewhere
  Edit the trigger that grabs the calculate coords/system name to clear those variables once it's done
